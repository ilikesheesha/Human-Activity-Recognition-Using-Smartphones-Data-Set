## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset description
See **Data/UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt** for a description of the UCI HAR dataset.

## Data files used
The following UCI HAR data files were used in fulfilling the requirements of the course project:

* activity_labels.txt - Which links the class labels with their activity name.
* features.txt - Which lists all features, and is used to identify the dataset data columns.
* test/subject_test.txt - Which identifies the subject that performed the test activity for each window sample.
* test/X_test.txt - Which contains the test dataset.
* test/y_test.txt - Which contains the test dataset labels, used to identify the activity performed for each window sample. Labels are linked to data in activity_labels.txt.
* train/subject_train.txt - Which identifies the subject that performed the training activity for each window sample.
* train/X_train.txt - Which contains the training dataset.
* train/y_train.txt - Which contains the training dataset labels, used to identify the activity performed for each window sample. Labels are linked to data in activity_labels.txt.
