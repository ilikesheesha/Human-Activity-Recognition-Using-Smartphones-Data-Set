#Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository is for the **Course Project** of the Coursera
**[Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata)** course.

The purpose of the project was for individuals to demonstrate their ability to collect, work with, and clean data. 

The **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set** was provided from the **[Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)** of UCI, and the following instructions were A dataset was provided, with the following instructions:

1. Create a tidy dataset
    1. Create a script called run_analysis.R that:
        1. Merges the training and the test sets into one dataset.
        2. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
        4. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
        5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    2. Upload the run_analysis.R to a Github repository
    3. Create a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data.
        1. Called the code book file CodeBook.md, and upload to the same Github repository as the run_analysis.R script.
    4. Create a repository README.md in the repository that explains explains the script(s), and the repository.
